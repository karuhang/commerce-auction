### Models (Database Structure)

The web application uses 5 models as follows:  
1. **User:** This is a predefined Django model who's username, email-id and password field we will be using in this web application.  

2. **Listing**: This model will store information regarding a listing. The fields are title, description, base price, current price, image(to save image URL of listing), category(type of listing), owner(Foreign Key to User), active(status of the listing), date.  

3. **Bid:** This model is used to register bids made by users. It contains information such as bidder(who is bidding - Foreign Key to User), bid(bid amount) and item(on which bid is being made - Foreign Key to Listing)  

4. **Comment:** This model stores all the comments made by various users on the listings. It stores listing(on which comment is made - Foreign Key to Listing), commentor(who made the comment - Foreign Key to User), comment, date(of comment).  

5. **Watchlist:** This models helps in keep tracking of the watchlist listings for users. It does so by storing the wisher(who is watching the listing) and the item(the listing that is being watched).
